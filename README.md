### 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
Answer:
i.When we search by a specific ID, we use getElementById() and it always returns an element.
ii.When searching for an element by a specific class name, getElementsByClassName() is used. It returns an HTML collection.
iii.querySelector() is a selector that returns the first element it matches. It can use ID, class and tag name etc.
iv.querySelectorAll() is a selector that returns all matching elements. This returns a NodeList which is static.

### 3. What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?
Answer:
Event Bubbling is a process where when an event occurs on a child element, it becomes the parent element and rises up the document. If we attach an event to a button, when we click on it, that event is triggered and propagated to its parent.

### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Answer:
Event delegation in JavaScript is the process of placing an event listener on a parent element so that events from a child can be handled.
This is useful because it eliminates the need to set up separate listeners for many child elements and it also works for dynamically added elements.

### 5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
Answer:
i.preventDefault():
Stops the default behavior of an event. For example, form submission, link redirection.
This essentially turns off the default action.
ii.stopPropagation():
Stops event bubbling or capturing, meaning the event will no longer propagate to the parent element.
This basically stops progression.
